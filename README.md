# Salesforce #

This library wraps the [Force.com REST API](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/). Force.com is a suite of point-and-click tools for creating custom employee-facing apps. The Electric Imp Salesforce library enables you to interact with your Force.com objects, allowing you to easily create products that can interact with a powerful CRM backend.

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "Salesforce.agent.lib.nut:2.0.1"` **to the top of your agent code.**

## Callbacks ##

All methods that make requests to the Force.com API can be called asynchronously (by providing the optional callback function) or synchronously (by not providing the callback). If a callback is supplied, it must take two parameters: *err* and *data*. If no errors were encountered, *err* will be `null` and *data* will contain the result of the request. If an error occurred during the request, *err* will contain the error information and *data* will be `null`.

If no callback is supplied (ie. a synchronous request was made), the method will return a table containing two fields, *err* and *data*, which follow the same conventions as outlined above.

**Note** If you receive an error with an *errorCode* of `"INVALID_SESSION_ID"` it means that your login is no longer valid (or that you never logged in).

## Class Usage ##

### Constructor: Salesforce(*consumerKey, consumerSecret[, loginService][, version]*) ##

To create a new Salesforce object you will need the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret of a Connected App. Information about creating a Connected App can be found [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=connected_app_create.htm). The constructor also allows you to pass in two additional parameters to override defaults: *loginService* (default value is `"login.salesforce.com"`) and *version* (default value is `"v33.0"`). If you are working in a Salesforce sandbox environment, you should pass `"test.salesforce.com"` as *loginService*.

```squirrel
#require "Salesforce.agent.lib.nut:2.0.1"

force <- Salesforce("<-- CONSUMER_KEY -->", "<-- CONSUMER_SECRET -->");
```

## Class Methods ##

### login(*username, password[, securityToken][, callback]*) ###

Once you’ve created a Salesforce object, you need to provide your login credentials via the *login()* method. This requires *username* and *password* parameter values. You may also provide an optional *securityToken* value (information about acquiring your security token can be found [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=user_security_token.htm)). The method may also be called with an optional callback function *([see above](#callbacks))* that will be executed upon the completion of the login request.

The data from *login()* consists of a table with a single field, *result*, which contains a boolean value indicating whether or not the login was successful.

```squirrel
force.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD, SECURITY_TOKEN, function(err, data) {
  if (err != null) {
    // if there was an error, log it
    server.error (err);
    return;
  }

  // If the login failed
  if (data.result == false) {
    server.error("Could not login");
    return;
  }

  // Do things after logging in...
 });
```

### isLoggedIn() ###

This method immediately returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the Salesforce object has completed a login request and stored the authentication token.

### setVersion(*versionString*) ###

This method can be used to set or change the version of the Force.com REST API you are working with. For example:

```squirrel
// Set to v27.0 instead of v33.0 (the default)
force.setVersion("v27.0");  
```

### setLoginService(*loginService*) ###

This method can be used to set or change the endpoint the Salesforce object uses in its login requests. For example:

```squirrel
//const ENVIRONMENT = "LIVE";
const ENVIRONMENT = "TEST";

// If we're not using our live Salesforce instance:
if (ENVIRONMENT == "TEST") force.setLoginService("https://test.salesforce.com");

// Login
// ...
```

### setToken(*token*) ###

This method can be used to manually set the token the Salesforce object uses in its requests. This method is intended to be used with the OAuth2 flow.

### setInstanceUrl(*URL*) ###

This method can be used to manually set or change the URL the Salesforce object uses in when constructing and sending requests.

### getRefreshToken() ###

This method will return the authentication’s [refresh token](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_refresh_token_flow.htm&language=en_US) if it exists. If the login flow did not result in a refresh token, or a succesfull call to *login()* has not yet been made, this method will return `null`. However, since the only authentication mechanism currently supported is username/password, which does not result in a refresh token, *getRefreshToken()* always returns `null`.

### getUser(*[callback]*) ###

This method makes a request to Salesforce to retrieve information about the user who is currently logged in. If a successful call to the *login()* method has not yet occurred, an error will be thrown. The method may also be called with an optional callback function *([see above](#callbacks))* that will be executed upon the completion of the request.

```squirrel
force.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD, SECURITY_TOKEN, function(err, data) {
  if (err != null || (data != null && data.result == false)) {
    server.error("Could not login to Salesforce");
    return;
  }

  force.getUser(function(err, data) {
    if (err) {
      server.error("ERROR: " + http.jsonencode(err));
      return;
    }

    // If it worked, log all the information we have about the user
    foreach(index, value in data) {
      server.log(index + ": " + value);
    }
  });
});
```

### request(*verb, service[, body][, callback]*) ###

This method is the most basic way of interacting with objects in your Salesforce database. It creates an HTTP request with properly formated authentication headers, etc. If a successful call to the *login()* method has not yet occurred, an error will be thrown. The method may also be called with an optional callback function *([see above](#callbacks))* that will be executed upon the completion of the login request.

The data from *request()* will be the parsed body of the request’s response. In the example below, we are fetching data on custom objects (campsites) from our Salesforce database:

```squirrel
force.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD, SECURITY_TOKEN, function(err, data) {
  if (err != null || (data != null && data.result == false)) {
    server.error("Could not login to Salesforce");
    return;
  }

  force.request("get", "sobjects/campsites__c", null, function(err, data) {
    if (err) {
      server.error("ERROR: " + http.jsonencode(err));
      return;
    }

    // Log the names of all the recent campsites
    if ("recentItems" in data) {
      server.log("Recent Campsites: ");
      foreach(campsite in data.recentItems) {
        server.log(campsite.Name);
      }
    }
  });
});
```
