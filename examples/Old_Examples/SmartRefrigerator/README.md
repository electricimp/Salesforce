# Salesforce Smart Refrigerator

This example uses the Electric Imp Platform to connect and monitor a refrigerator, and Salesforce to track the current temperature, humidity in the fridge, and whether the fridge door is open or closed.

The impExplorer&trade; Kit used in this example reads data from its sensors every 15 seconds. It reads the temperature and the humidity of the air around it, and sends those readings to Salesforce using Salesforce Platform Events. The impExplorer Kit also senses light and uses this to determine whether the fridge door is open (bright light) or closed (no light). Again, the light-level reading is sent to Salesforce using Salesforce Platform Events.

Salesforce stores the incoming data and opens a Case using IoT Explorer Orchestration if one of the following occurs.

1. The refrigerator door is open for longer than a predefined period.
2. The temperature rises above a predefined threshold.
3. The relative humidity rises above a predefined threshold.

All thresholds are defined later, at the step when you set up IoT Explorer Orchestration.

**Note** This example has not been updated to use OAuth2 library to authenticate with Salesforce, and so it has not been updated to use the the latest version of the Salesforce library. Instead it is using v2.0.1 of the Salesforce library. Please ignore any warnings in the ide about updating to the latest library version.

## Step 1: What You Need

### General

- Your 2.4GHz 802.11n Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password.
- A smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android).
- A computer with a web browser.

### Accounts

- An [Electric Imp developer account](https://impcentral.electricimp.com/login).
- The Electric Imp mobile app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/electric-imp/id547133856) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electricimp.electricimp)).
- A [Salesforce Developer Edition](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or [Trailhead Playground org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) account.

### Hardware

- An Electric Imp [impExplorer Kit](https://store.electricimp.com/collections/featured-products/products/impexplorer-developer-kit-for-salesforce-trailhead?variant=31720746706).
- 3 AA batteries (to run the board from inside a fridge).

## Step 2: Set up the Electric Imp Hardware

First we will need to assemble the impExplorer Kit. The kit comes with.

- An imp001 card, which contains a Wi-Fi radio and the microcontroller that drives all the logic for the board.
- The impExplorer board into which the card is plugged.

The impExplorer’s imp001 connects to any **2.4GHz** WiFi network compatible with the **802.11n** standard or below. It cannot connect to a 5GHz 802.11n network. For more information on imp network requirements, please see [*Network Requirements for imp-enabled Devices*](https://electricimp.com/docs/troubleshooting/networks/).

### Hardware Setup

- Plug the imp001 card into the card slot on the impExplorer.
- Power up your impExplorer Kit with the provided mini-B USB cable or the AA batteries.
- The imp001 should now have power and be blinking amber (or red if it has been used before).

Assembled, it should look like this.

![Assembled impExplorer Kit: the imp001 card in place (left) and the three AA batteries in the underside bay (right)](png/0_1.png "Assembled impExplorer Kit: the imp001 card in place (left) and the three AA batteries in the underside bay (right)")

### Electric Imp BlinkUp&trade;

Use the Electric Imp mobile app to activate your device: configure it with Wi-Fi access credentials and enroll it into the Electric Imp impCloud&trade;. Activation takes place through a process called BlinkUp.

1. Launch the app.
1. Sign into your Electric Imp account.
1. At the main menu, tap **Configure a Device**.
1. Select **Wireless**.
1. Enter your Wi-Fi credentials.
1. Follow the instructions in the app to activate your device.
1. After a successful BlinkUp, the app will show you your impExplorer’s unique device ID. You will need this later.

When you enter your Wi-Fi details, the app may set the SSID field for you. It will enter the name of the network your phone or tablet is connected to. This may not be the one you wish to connect your impExplorer to; if not, just tap on the name to key in the correct SSID.

The impExplorer needs to connect to a **2.4GHz 802.11n** Wi-Fi network, so you will need to make sure one is available. This is especially the case if your phone is connected to a 5GHz network as the impExplorer will not be able to connect to this. You may need to set up a separate or guest network to try this example. If in doubt, consult your network manager.

If you have any issues getting started with your Electric Imp account or device, please follow Steps 1 through 7 in [the full getting started guide](https://electricimp.com/docs/gettingstarted/explorer/quickstartguide/).

### The Electric Imp Platform

The Electric Imp IoT Connectivity Platform has two core elements: the device and the impCloud&trade;. The device runs software of its own (the imp application’s ‘device code’) and is assisted by software running in the impCloud. This assistant is called an ‘agent’, and each device has an agent all of its own. The agent (running the imp application’s ‘agent code’) operates as the device’s front end to the Internet.

In this example, the agent code receives data from the device and forwards it to Salesforce as a Platform Event, as the following diagram shows.

![An Electric Imp Application: the device, running device code, connects to its agent in the impCloud. The agent, running agent code, is the device's front end to the Internet, and communicates with external resources such as Salesforce](png/0_2.jpg "An Electric Imp Application: the device, running device code, connects to its agent in the impCloud. The agent, running agent code, is the device's front end to the Internet, and communicates with external resources such as Salesforce")

Electric Imp applications are developed and managed in an online tool called impCentral&trade;. This web app provides all the facilities you need to write and deploy the software (to the device and to the agent) that will control your imp-enabled connected product. For more details on impCentral, see [‘Introduction to impCentral’](https://electricimp.com/docs/tools/impcentral/impcentralintroduction/).

## Step 3: Enter Device and Agent Code

1. In your favorite web browser log into [impCentral](https://preview-impcentral.electricimp.com/login).
1. Click **Create a Product**.
![Click on the Create a Product button in impCentral](png/202.png "Click on the Create a Product button in impCentral")
1. In the popup, enter a Product name (e.g., **SmartFridge**), an Application Workspace name (e.g., **SmartFridge**), and then click **Create**.
![Enter a Product name and the name of an Application Workspace in the Create Product popup](png/202.png "Enter a Product name and the name of an Application Workspace in the Create Product popup")<br>A Product defines a new connected product in the Electric Imp impCloud. An Application Workspace is the place where you develop and test your application software, both the device code and the agent code.
1. Copy and paste the [agent code](./SmartRefrigerator_ExplorerKit_Salesforce.agent.nut) from Github into the left-hand window pane as shown in the image below.
1. Copy and paste the [device code](./SmartRefrigerator_ExplorerKit_Salesforce.device.nut) from Github into the right-hand window pane as shown in the image below.
1. Click **Assign devices**.
![Click on the Assign Devices link in impCentral's logging pane](png/203.png "Click on the Assign Devices link in impCentral's logging pane")
1. In the **Assign Devices** popup, choose your impExplorer by locating its device ID, and click **Assign**.
![Select your impExplorer and click Assign in the Assign Devices popup](png/204.png "Select your impExplorer and click Assign in the Assign Devices popup")
1. At the top of the logs pane you can find the agent URL of your device. It will look something like this: **https://agent.electricimp.com/szPc0sLfAqlu**
1. Make a note of the agent URL. You will need it when you create your connected app in Salesforce.
![Make a note of the agent URL that is now listed at the head of the logging pane](png/205.png "Make a note of the agent URL that is now listed at the head of the logging pane")
1. Leave impCentral open in your browser &mdash; you will be returning to it later.

## Salesforce IoT Explorer

The data received from the device may be processed, stored, and analyzed within Salesforce. This example demonstrates just a few of the many capabilities of Salesforce, which can be modified or extended as you explore further.

In this example, you create the following Salesforce entities:

- **Connected Application** (Step 4) Authenticates the imp application in Salesforce so that Platform Events sent by the imp application are accepted by Salesforce.
- **Custom Object** (Step 5) Stores the data received from the device so that the historical data can be monitored, for example using the Salesforce1 mobile app.
- **Platform Event** (Step 6) Transfers the data from the device to Salesforce. A **Platform Event Trigger** inserts the received data into the Custom Object.
- **IoT Explorer Context** (Step 7) Lets you set up IoT Explorer Orchestration.
- **Custom Case Field** (Step 8) Opens customized **Cases**: a standard **Case** object with an additional field, the device ID.
- **IoT Explorer Orchestration** (Step 9) Defines a fridge state machine that reacts to incoming Platform Events and opens Cases as required.
- **Custom Object Tab** (Step 12) Lets you make the Custom Object (with the stored data from the device) accessible from the Salesforce1 mobile app.

The Platform Event acts as an interface between the imp application and Salesforce. The Platform Event fields must have the names and types used in this example (see Step 6). If you change anything in the Platform Event definition, you will need to update the imp application’s agent source code. The name of the Platform Event is set in the agent code by the constant *READING_EVENT_NAME*.

All other entities listed above are fully independent of the imp application.

In this project, we explore a specific example, but this is just one scenario you can use. As you continue to explore using Electric Imp with Salesforce, you can try out different scenarios with new fields, rules, sets of entities, and more.

![Verify that all of the SmartFridge Custom Object's new fields have been set correctly before proceeding](png/11.png "Verify that all of the SmartFridge Custom Object's new fields have been set correctly before proceeding")

## Step 6: Create Platform Events in Salesforce

Platform Events transfer the data from the device to Salesforce. A Platform Event Trigger inserts the received data into the Custom Object we just defined.

The Platform Event fields must have the names and types mentioned here. If you change anything in the Platform Event definition, you will need to update the imp application’s agent code. The name of the Platform Event is entered into the agent code as a constant, *READING_EVENT_NAME*.

1. On the Salesforce page, click the **Setup** icon in the top-right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Enter **Platform Events** into the **Quick Find** box and then select **Data > Platform Events**.

1. In the **Custom Fields & Relationships** section, click **New** to create a field for the timestamp:
    1. Data Type: **Date/Time**
    1. Click **Next**.
    1. Field Label: **ts**
    1. Field Name: **ts**
    1. Click **Save**.
1. In the **Custom Fields & Relationships** section, click **New** create a field for the device’s ID:
    1. Data Type: **Text**
    1. Click **Next**.
    1. Field Label: **deviceId**
    1. Length: **16**
    1. Field Name: **deviceId**
    1. Check **Always require a value in this field in order to save a record**.
    1. Click **Save**.
1. Make sure that the **Smart Fridge Reading API Name** is **Smart_Fridge_Reading__e** and that **Custom Fields & Relationships** looks like this.
![Verify that the Platform Event's fields and settings are correct before proceeding](png/19.png "Verify that the Platform Event's fields and settings are correct before proceeding")
1. In the **Triggers** section, click **New**.
![Click the New button in the Triggers section](png/55.png "Click the New button in the Triggers section")
1. Enter the following code:
```
trigger SmartFridgeReadingReceived on Smart_Fridge_Reading__e (after insert) {
  List<SmartFridge__c> records = new List<SmartFridge__c>();
  for (Smart_Fridge_Reading__e event : Trigger.New) {
    SmartFridge__c record = new SmartFridge__c();
    record.deviceId__c = event.deviceId__c;
    record.temperature__c = event.temperature__c;
    record.humidity__c = event.humidity__c;
    record.door__c = event.door__c;
    record.ts__c = event.ts__c;
    records.add(record);
  }
  insert records;
}
```
![The Apex Trigger screen with the provided code in place](png/56.png "The Apex Trigger screen with the provided code in place")
1. Click **Save**.

**Note** Typically, you would use an Orchestration to update the SmartFridge records, but since we are not implementing any logic or decision-making for this step, we use the Apex Trigger as an alternative to Orchestration. This approach may help you with any troubleshooting.

### Adding Salesforce ID Data to Your Agent Code

1. Return to impCentral.
1. Find the *SALESFORCE CONSTANTS* section at the **end** of the agent code and make sure your **READING_EVENT_NAME** constant value is **Smart_Fridge_Reading__e** (ie. the same as **Smart Fridge Reading API Name** value of the Platform Event you just created).
![In impCentral, add your Salesforce Platform Event's name to the place provided in the agent code](png/206.png "In impCentral, add your Salesforce Platform Event's name to the place provided in the agent code")
1. Again, do not close impCentral.

## Step 7: Create a Context in Salesforce

This is needed to help set up the IoT Explorer Orchestration.

1. On the Salesforce page, click the **Setup** icon in the top-right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Enter **Contexts** into the **Quick Find** box and then select **Contexts**.
![Key Contexts into the Quick Find box and then click on Feature Settings, IoT Explorer and Contexts](png/22.png "Key Contexts into the Quick Find box and then click on Feature Settings, IoT Explorer and Contexts")
1. Click **New Context**.
1. In the **New Context** form, fill in:
    1. Context Name: **Smart Fridge Context**
    1. Key Type: **String**
    1. Click **Save**.
1. You will be redirected to the **Smart Fridge Context** page. In the **Platform Events** section, click **Add**.
![In the Context's Platform Events section, click the Add button](png/23.png "In the Context's Platform Events section, click the Add button")
1. In the **Add Platform Event** form, fill in:
    1. Context: **Smart Fridge Context**
    1. Platform Event: choose the **Smart Fridge Reading** Platform Event you created earlier.
    1. Key: choose **deviceId**
    1. Click **Save**.

## Step 8: Create a Custom Case Field in Salesforce

This example uses customized Cases which are standard Case objects with an additional field for device ID.

1. On the Salesforce page, click **Setup** icon in the top-right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Click the **Object Manager** tab next to **Home**.
![On the Salesforce navigation bar, click on the Object Manager tab](png/5_1.png "On the Salesforce navigation bar, click on the Object Manager tab")
1. Click **Case**.
1. Select the **Fields & Relationships** section and click **New**.
![In the Object Manager setup page, select the Fields and Relationships section then click the New button](png/13.png "In the Object Manager setup page, select the Fields and Relationships section then click the New button")
1. In the **New Custom Field** form:
    1. In the **Step 1. Choose the field type** section:
        1. Data Type: **Text**
        1. Click **Next**.
    1. In the **Step 2. Enter the details** section:
        1. Field Label: **deviceId**
        1. Length: **16**
        1. Field Name: **deviceId**
        1. Check **Set this field as the unique record identifier from an external system**.
![Enter the details for the device ID custom field](png/14.png "Enter the details for the device ID custom field")
    1. Click **Next**, **Next** and then **Save**.
1. Select the **Fields & Relationships** section and find your newly created **deviceId** custom field.
1. Make sure the **Field Name** is set to **deviceId__c**.
![Verify that the device ID field name is correct before processing](png/15.png "Verify that the device ID field name is correct before processing")

## Step 9: Create an Orchestration in Salesforce

This example demonstrates how to create an Orchestration. A Salesforce Orchestration defines a fridge state machine. You can see in the following diagram how a fridge is normally in the 'Default' state but will move to one of the other states as it reacts to Platform Events. In this example, as the device moves into these other states, the Orchestration will open Cases based the following specific rules, which are set up as part of the Orchestration:

1. The refrigerator door is opened during three consecutive data readings (the exact threshold is between 30 and 45 seconds).
2. The temperature rises above 11&deg;C.
3. The relative humidity rises above 70%.

![An Orchestration defines a state machine: the current and possible states that a device may be in, plus actions that will be triggered when those states are entered](png/100a.png "An Orchestration defines a state machine: the current and possible states that a device may be in, plus actions that will be triggered when those states are entered")

If you are wondering why there are no transitions between Open, Temperature Over Threshold and Humidity Over Threshold, it is because such transitions would result in multiple cases being opened simultaneously. This should be avoided, so the state machine is set up to ensure that further cases won’t be created until a given issue is resolved and the impExplorer returned to the Default state.

### Create the Orchestration

1. Make sure there are periodic logs like this: **[Agent] Readings sent successfully**.
1. Your application is now up and running.

## Step 11: Place Your impExplorer Kit in a Refrigerator

Open your refrigerator and place the impExplorer Kit on a shelf in your refrigerator door.

![The impExplorer Kit place on the shelf of a refrigerator ready for sensing](png/0_3.png "The impExplorer Kit place on the shelf of a refrigerator ready for sensing")

If you don’t have a fridge handy for this scenario, you can test the example by emulating different conditions. For example, you can emulate a fridge door being open or closed by placing the impExplorer under a light or into a really dark place. Emulate the high temperature case by moving the device from a cold place to a much warmer one.

## Step 12: Monitor the Transmitted Data

You can use the Salesforce1 mobile app to see the data that your device sends. To do this, you need to perform the following tasks.

### 1. Create a Custom Object Tab

This is needed to make the Custom Object with the stored data from the device accessible by Salesforce1.

1. Return to Salesforce.
1. Click the **Setup** icon in the top -right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Enter **Tabs** into the **Quick Find** box and select **Tabs**.
1. Under **Custom Object Tabs**, click **New**.
1. Choose **SmartFridge** from the **Object** dropdown.
1. Choose **Thermometer** as the Tab Style.<br>
![Choose Thermometer as the SmartFridge object's Tab Style](png/300.png "Choose Thermometer as the SmartFridge object's Tab Style")
1. Click **Next**, **Next**, and then **Save**.

### 2. Check Salesforce1 is Enabled

1. Click the **Setup** icon in the top-right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Enter **Salesforce1** into the **Quick Find** box and select **Salesforce1 Settings**.
1. Make sure the **Enable the Salesforce1 mobile browser app** is checked.<br>
![Check Enable the Salesforce1 mobile browser app](png/301.png "Enable the Salesforce1 mobile browser app")
1. Enter **Users** in the **Quick Find** box and select **Users**
1. Click **Edit** next to your username.
1. Make sure that **Salesforce1 User** is checked. If not, check it and click **Save**.<br>
![Check Salesforce1 User](png/302.png "Check Salesforce1 User")

### 3. Run Salesforce1

You can access and run Salesforce1 in three ways.

- As a mobile app that you download from the Apple iTunes Store or Google Play, and install and run on your phone. This is the recommended approach.
- By opening the **login.salesforce.com** page in a browser on your phone.
- By using the Chrome Developer Tools (described below).

#### Open Salesforce1 in Chrome Browser

Use this approach if you want or need to run Salesforce1 on your PC, not on a mobile phone. It is possible to emulate Salesforce1 in the Chrome web browser.

1. On the Salesforce page, click the **Setup** icon in the top-right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Copy the current opened URL into clipboard.
1. Open a new tab in your Chrome browser.
1. Open the Chrome Developer Tools by clicking **View** > **Developer** > **Developer Tools**.
1. Click the **Toggle Device Mode** button to simulate your browser as a mobile device.
![The Toggle Device Mode button on the Chrome browser](png/303.png "The Toggle Device Mode button on the Chrome browser")
1. Paste the URL you copied before. **Do not press Enter**.
1. Remove the part of the URL immediately after **lightning.force.com**. For example:
![Edit the URL](png/95.png "Edit the URL")
![The edited URL](png/96.png "The edited URL")
1. Append **/one/one.app** to the end of the URL after force.com. For example:
![The correct URL](png/97.png "The correct URL")
1. Press Enter. Salesforce1 emulation will start up in Chrome. If the display is too small, change the size to 100%:<br>
![Set the device emulation zoom level in Chrome](png/304.png "Set the device emulation zoom level in Chrome")
1. Click the hamburger menu in the upper left to open the navigation panel.
1. Under the **Recent** section, scroll down and click **More**.<br>
![Select More from the menu's Recent section](png/305.png "Select More from the menu's Recent section")
1. Find **SmartFridges** on the list and then click it.<br>
![Select SmartFridges from the menu's Recent section](png/306.png "Select SmartFridges from the menu's Recent section")
1. Select a record to view the details of the reading.<br>
![Select a record to view the details of the reading](png/99.png "Select a record to view the details of the reading")

## Step 13: Monitor Orchestration State Transitions and Cases

You can now see transitions between the states that you defined in the IoT Explorer Orchestration section, as well as registered Cases.

1. On the Salesforce page, click the **Setup** icon in the top-right navigation menu and select **Setup**.
![Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon](png/1_1.png "Select Setup from the top-right gearwheel icon")
1. Enter **Orchestrations** into the **Quick Find** box and select **Orchestrations**.
![Key Orchestrations into the Quick Find box and then click on Feature Settings, IoT Explorer and Orchestrations](png/24.png "Key Orchestrations into the Quick Find box and then click on Feature Settings, IoT Explorer and Orchestrations")
1. Click **Smart Fridge Orchestration**.
1. Click the **TRAFFIC** tab.
1. If your impExplorer is inside a fridge, you should see that your device is in the **Default** normal state:
![The impExplorer in its default state](png/100.png "The impExplorer in its default state")
1. Keep the fridge door open for over 45 seconds (or just place the impExplorer in a brightly lit room). On the **TRAFFIC** tab, you should see that your device has now moved into the **Door Open** state:
![The impExplorer enters the door-open state](png/101.png "The impExplorer enters the door-open state")
1. Move the impExplorer to a warm dark place. On the **TRAFFIC** tab, you should see that your device has now moved into the **Temperature Over Threshold** state:
![The impExplorer triggers a temperature-over-threshold warning](png/102.png "The impExplorer triggers a temperature-over-threshold warning")
1. Run Salesforce1 as described in Step 12.
1. Click the hamburger menu in the upper left to open the navigation panel.
1. Under the **Recent** section, click **Cases**.<br>
![Select Cases from the menu's Recent section](png/103.png "Select Cases from the menu's Recent section")
1. You will see the registered Cases:<br>
![The list of recent cases](png/104.png "The list of recent cases")

**Note** The Orchestration Traffic view is on a seven-second refresh but Platform Events are processed as they are received. This means you may see the Case created before the UI refreshes.
